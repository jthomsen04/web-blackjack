This is an in-development blackjack game running on GAE, making use of GQL database structures and memcache. The game can be found at web-blackjack.appspot.com and is optimized for playing within the Chrome browser.

The web-app version is built on top of an object-oriented initial version designed specifically to be played in a terminal window. This version (blackjack.py) is imported to the web app code (game.py) which is run by the routing path to blackjack in the webapp.

Currently, all features except for splitting are supported by the game, although the Alpha Build of Web-Blackjack  Version 3 shows some features of how splitting is being implemented and tracked by the game.
